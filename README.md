Project Summary:

The art of orally telling a story is lost in today’s world.

We believe in creating platforms for people to express themselves and tell their story.

Using the “Interview Project”, by David Lynch (David Lynch Interview Project | MIT – Docubase 1) as an inspiration, we will create 5 minute video-portraits with the purpose of showing stories everyone should listen too, told by those who have lived them. These stories can be about an infinite range of topics, like childhood stories, political statements, jokes, about nothing in special; it all depends on those who are being portrayed, who will have absolute freedom of speech.

Plus, we want, and this is of extreme importance to us, to create NFT’s with each one of the videos and share the royalties with the people interviewed.

That way, not only that person is actually being valued both in social and financial terms, but also being recognized as a valuable member of our society. By helping them with financial literacy (cryptocurrencies, how to create and use a wallet, etc), we want to send a clear message: no one should be left behind.

The idea that a smart-contract with split royalties can bring justice to the way people connect and work together is fundamental in out world view, and we want to explore and refine it.
